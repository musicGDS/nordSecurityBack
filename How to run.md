# API
Navigate to the project folder with file explorer and open terminal;
Run "dotnet test" ir should build and run the test suite;
Will not work as it is because I could not get 200 response from the api (only 404);

# UI
Navigate to the project folder with file explorer and open terminal;
Run "dotnet test" ir should build and run the test suite;
If test fails to run please install chromium browser using this command:
pwsh bin/Debug/net6.0/playwright.ps1 install --with-deps
The teste execution is slowed down so it would be possible what browser is doing;
